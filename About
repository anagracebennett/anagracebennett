- Hello, I am a current student at Florida State University, pursuing a dual degree in Economics and Finance with a minor in Computer Science. Primarily, my studies and career concentration is in data analytics and investments. 
Feel free to reach out to discuss finance, computer programming projects, and environmental research. I am also interested in connecting over fashion trends and travel experiences, especially international.
Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. Feel free to connect on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/anagracebennett/.
