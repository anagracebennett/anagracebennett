- 👋 Hello, I am a current student at Florida State University, pursuing a dual degree in Economics and Finance with a minor in Computer Science. Primarily, my studies and career concentration is in data analytics and investments. 
Feel free to reach out to discuss finance, computer programming projects, and environmental research. I am also interested in connecting over fashion trends and travel experiences, especially international.
Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me.
